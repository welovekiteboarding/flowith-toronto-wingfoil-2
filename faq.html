<think>The user wants me to continue generating the FAQ page (`faq.html`). I need to ensure the navigation and footer links are updated to include the new `community.html` and `events.html` pages, and that the content reflects the new information where appropriate (e.g., linking to community/events pages in relevant FAQs). I also need to make sure I complete the partial `div` from the previous output.

Okay, planning complete. I will continue with `faq.html`, focusing on:
1.  Completing the "Getting Started" FAQ section from the previous output.
2.  Adding new FAQ sections for "Lessons & Equipment", "Safety & Technical", "Booking & Logistics", and a new section for "Community & Events".
3.  Ensuring all internal links (especially to new pages like `community.html` and `events.html`) are correct.
4.  Updating the header navigation and footer navigation to include "Community" and "Events".
5.  Maintaining the existing design style and structure.
6.  Ensuring the `script.js` tag is present.
7.  Concluding with ``.-6">

                                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">What is wingfoiling?</h3>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling (also called wingsurfing) is a water sport that combines elements of windsurfing, kiteboarding, and foiling. You stand on a board equipped with a hydrofoil underneath, while holding a hand-held inflatable wing to harness the wind's power. As you gain speed, the hydrofoil lifts the board above the water, creating a smooth gliding sensation. It's known for being relatively easy to learn and offering a unique "flying" experience.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need any prior water sports experience?</h3>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    No prior experience is necessary! While previous experience with board sports (surfing, windsurfing, kiteboarding, paddleboarding, etc.) can be helpful for balance, wingfoiling is designed to be accessible to beginners. Our <a href="discovery-lesson.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Discovery Lesson</a> is specifically structured for first-timers with no prior water sports background, covering everything from basic wing control on land to getting on the board in shallow water.

                                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Is wingfoiling difficult to learn?</h3>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling is significantly easier to learn than both kiteboarding and windsurfing. Most students can start getting short flights on the foil within 2-3 lessons. The hand-held wing is intuitive to use, and the learning curve is much gentler than other wind-powered water sports because you are not tethered directly to the power source and can easily release the wing. Our step-by-step lessons emphasize rapid progression in a safe environment, utilizing Toronto's suitable learning spots.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling is accessible to people with moderate fitness levels. You don't need exceptional strength or flexibility, but you should be comfortable in the water and have reasonable balance and coordination. The sport is relatively low-impact, making it suitable for a wide range of ages and fitness levels. The primary demands are balance and core strength, which improve quickly with practice. Initial lessons involve some walking in shallow water and getting up on the board, which requires some effort but is manageable for most.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling is suitable for a wide range of ages. We typically teach students from teenagers (around 12-14 years old, depending on size and maturity) to seniors. The most important factors are comfort in the water, a willingness to learn, and the ability to follow instructions. For younger participants (under 16), we recommend a parent or guardian be present during lessons.

                                    Water conditions on Lake Ontario around Toronto can vary. Depending on the <a href="locations.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">location</a> and wind:
                                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">

                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Chop:</span> With onshore winds or stronger winds, you can expect some chop. Learning to handle small chop is part of the progression. Our beginner boards offer good stability in these conditions.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Waves:</span> Larger waves are less common at our primary teaching locations unless there are strong, sustained onshore winds. We generally avoid teaching in significant wave conditions for beginner and intermediate lessons. Our <a href="advanced-lesson.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Advanced Lessons</a> may cover basic lake wave riding if conditions are suitable.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Water Temperature:</span> Lake Ontario water can be cool, especially in spring and fall. We provide wetsuits appropriate for the conditions to ensure your comfort. Summer water temperatures are generally pleasant.

                                    We provide all the equipment needed for wingfoiling, including the wing, board, foil, wetsuit (if needed), helmet, and personal flotation device (PFD)/impact vest. See our <a href="gear.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Gear page</a> for details.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    This varies by individual, but many students experience their first "flights" on the foil during their second or third lesson (<a href="beginner-lesson.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Beginner Lesson</a>). A typical progression might include:
                                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                        <li>1-2 Discovery Lessons: To learn the absolute basics, wing control, and comfortable board riding without foiling.</li>
                                        <li>2-3 Beginner Lessons: To work on water starts, first foil flights, and basic foil control.</li>
                                        <li>1-2 Intermediate Lessons: To refine foiling technique, achieve sustained flights, learn basic transitions, and gain more confidence.</li>
                                        <li>1+ Advanced Lessons: For those looking to master foiling tacks, jibes, jumps, or other advanced techniques, the number of lessons depends on individual goals and progression. See our <a href="advanced-lesson.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Advanced Lesson</a> page for more.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    So, roughly 3-6 lessons (6-12 hours of instruction) can get many people to a point where they can practice independently in suitable conditions. However, some students progress faster or slower depending on factors like prior board sport experience, physical coordination, and time spent practicing. Patience and consistent practice are key.

This allows you to focus on learning without the significant upfront cost of gear. We recommend waiting until you've progressed through several lessons and are consistently foiling before considering purchasing your own equipment. At that point, you'll have a better understanding of what gear suits your needs and the conditions you expect to ride in frequent Toronto locations.

Safety is our top priority, and we monitor wind and weather conditions closely using various local Toronto forecasts and live conditions. We typically assess conditions and communicate any potential cancellations at least a few hours in advance, but sometimes sudden weather changes on Lake Ontario require adjustments on the day of the lesson.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling is generally considered safer than kiteboarding, especially for beginners, but still requires proper instruction and safety awareness. The wing is held in your hands rather than being attached to you via long lines, which significantly reduces the risk of being unexpectedly pulled or dragged. This hand-held setup also allows you to easily release and depower the wing in case of difficulty. However, the hydrofoil itself is a sharp object and requires respect and proper technique to use safely to avoid cuts or impacts. Our lessons include comprehensive safety instruction covering equipment handling, emergency procedures, self-rescue techniques, understanding right-of-way rules on the water, and awareness of specific hazards at Toronto locations. Please review our dedicated <a href="safety.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Safety Page</a> for detailed guidelines.

                                    Yes, you should be comfortable swimming in open water. While you'll wear a personal flotation device (PFD) during lessons, basic swimming ability is important for safety and confidence in the water, especially in unforeseen circumstances or if you become separated from your board. You don't need to be an Olympic swimmer, but should be able to swim at least 50 meters comfortably and tread water. Being calm and confident in the water is a key factor in safe learning.

                                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">How much wind is needed for wingfoiling? What if it's too windy or not windy enough in Toronto?</h3>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling can be enjoyed in a wide range of wind conditions. For beginners, we recommend and teach in steady winds between 10-18 knots (approximately 18-33 km/h). This provides enough power to learn fundamental wing control and practice getting on the board without being too strong.
                                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Too little wind (under 10 knots):</span> It becomes very difficult to generate enough power, especially for beginners. We would likely reschedule.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Too much wind (over 20-22 knots for beginners):</span> Can be overwhelming and unsafe for learning. We would also reschedule.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    As your skills advance, you can wingfoil in lighter winds (7-10 knots with larger gear and good pumping technique) or stronger winds (up to 25+ knots with smaller gear). Toronto's wind conditions can vary, so we always check multiple forecasts before confirming a lesson.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Wingfoiling combines elements of both sports but with some key differences, particularly making it more accessible for beginners:

                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Wing vs. Sail/Kite:</span> The wing is handheld and inflatable, not attached to the board like a windsurfing sail, nor controlled by long lines like a kite. This offers more intuitive control and easier depowering.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Learning Curve:</span> Generally gentler and faster than both windsurfing and kiteboarding.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Setup:</span> Simpler and quicker equipment setup.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Safety:</span> Easier to manage in difficult situations as you can simply let go of the wing.</li>
                                        <li><span class="font-semibold">The Foil:</span> The hydrofoil lifts the board out of the water, providing a unique "flying" sensation and smooth ride over chop, distinct from surface riding in traditional windsurfing or kiteboarding.</li>

                                    The primary wingfoiling season in Toronto on Lake Ontario runs from late spring (typically May) through early fall (October), when water and air temperatures are more comfortable for lessons and general riding. Water temperatures in Lake Ontario can be quite cold outside this window. Advanced riders with proper cold-water gear (thick wetsuits, booties, gloves, hood) sometimes extend their season into late fall or even brave winter sessions in milder years, but this is significantly more challenging, requires specialized gear, and is not suitable for learning. We offer lessons during the primary season when conditions and water temperatures are most suitable for a safe and enjoyable learning experience.

                                    Yes, we offer private lessons for individuals who prefer one-on-one instruction or have specific learning goals they want to focus on. Private lessons are available at all skill levels (Discovery, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and provide personalized attention and a customized learning plan tailored specifically to your needs and progression speed. Private lessons can accelerate your learning significantly. Please see our <a href="pricing.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">pricing page</a> for details on private lesson rates or <a href="contact.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">contact us</a> to discuss.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    Yes, we offer discounts for groups of 3 or more people booking lessons together (e.g., for our standard Discovery, Beginner, or Intermediate lessons). Group lessons can be a fun and cost-effective way to learn wingfoiling with friends, family, or colleagues. While group lessons offer a dynamic learning environment, the instruction is still structured to ensure individual progress. Please <a href="contact.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">contact us</a> directly with your group size and desired dates to discuss group rates and scheduling options.
